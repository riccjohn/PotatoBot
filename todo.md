# To Do

### Commands to implement

- [ ] Commenting rolls => `/r 1d20+5 # Grog attacks` ==> `@PotatoBeard:  1d20+5 Grog attacks = (19)+5 = 24`
- [ ] Keep 3 highest rolls => `!r 4d6k3`
- [ ] Roll with advantage (Roll twice and keep highest) => `2d20k1`
- [ ] Roll with disadvantage (Roll twice and keep lowest) => `2d20kl1`
- [ ] Adding rolls =>`!r 1d8 + 4d6` - Roll one octahedron and four hexahedrons.
